  http://drupal.org/search/node/firephp

-------------------------------
 Version 0.1.x
-------------------------------

- FirePHP::LIST log style

- Automatic updates for FF3

-------------------------------
 Version 0.2.x
-------------------------------

- FB1.2 - Print INFO message instead of FirePHP messages in FB console when response came from cache
				- Print NOTE on server tab if data came from cache
        - Use Firebug NetMonitor to listen for request activity.
          http://groups.google.com/group/firebug/browse_frm/thread/267b1f4abf79bdc3?hl=en#
          http://code.google.com/p/fbug/issues/detail?id=587
				- Add FirePHP panel that is disabled by default and asks users to enable it for each website
          just like the Net panel does in FB1.2

- Optionally allow variable inspection in sidebar or browser overaly instead of the DOM tab

- Refactor FirePHPRenderer API to introduce:
	 - ProcessRequest - to be called automatically after every request load (DONE)
	 - RenderRequest - to be called when "Server" tab is clicked
	 - SetRequestHTML - to be called by renderer to make the rendered HTML visible for the request
	 
- Initialize a new Renderer object for every unique renderer URL. When the requests
  are handled call the appropriate renderer. Allow different renderers to exist
  at the same time for different request URL's.

- Allow the ProcessRequest method to render debug data in dedicated FirePHP panel.
	=> Will log to firebug console for now.

- Test suite to allow testing of Renderers outside of Firebug (in main browser)
  and thus allow debugging of renderer code using firebug.
  
- Plugin system for default renderer and processor to add custom functionality easily  
  
- Expanding of stack trace does not work after Firebug is detached.
  Need to reload page at the moment.

- Add option to hide all the X-FirePHP- headers from the Firebug response headers viewer

-------------------------------
 Deferred
-------------------------------

- New style/template for console groups. The spacing between characters is irritating
	=> Looked into this. Cannot be done without modifying Firebug at this time.
	
-------------------------------
 Known Issues
-------------------------------

- FirePHP not called when only headers are sent without body content
  http://groups.google.com/group/FirePHP/browse_frm/thread/a7a9b725824daa18?hl=en  
  => Problem with FF2. Works in FF3.
  
- FF2 - When Firefox is first started and a page is called that uses FirePHP, sometimes the
  request processor is called twice.
	=> I am going to leave this alone. The request monitoring in FF2 is a mess.
	   Will work fine in FF3.
